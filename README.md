# Password_Generator
I made a Password Generator that can customize your password as per the user specification. The thing is that I did not do the GUI. So I will do that later right in this repository. Make sure you enter the right numbers or you might get baffled!!

# Note
this program will not generate any error message. But it is better to follow the rules of this program!  The only error generated will be is when you type a string onto the terminal where the integer datatype should be.
